## üìö Recommended Design Pattern for this Library: Double Using + JSON Persistence

### What is the `Double Using` pattern?

The `Double Using` pattern is an organized and efficient way to work with vector indices when you want to:

- Quickly load and insert data using a **FLAT** index.
- Automatically persist them as a `.json` file.
- Load that data into a **hierarchical** index (like HNSW or NSW) for much faster searches.

### üéØ Why JSON and not binary files?

Unlike native methods that generate opaque binary dumps, JSON persistence:

- ‚úÖ Is **readable** and **portable**.
- ‚úÖ Lets you **see the actual content** (vectors, IDs, index type, etc.).
- ‚úÖ Is **more maintainable** for debugging, versioning, and tests.
- ‚úÖ Doesn't tie you to how the core C index is serialized.

- This gives you total traceability: you know exactly what you saved, when, how, and you can restore it without depending on a native binary format.

### üß™ Full Example of the Double Using Pattern

```csharp
[Test]
public void DoubleUsing_DumpFlatAndLoadHNSW_ShouldWork()
{
    // Step 1: Create FLAT index, insert, and persist
    using (var flat = new VictorSDK(IndexType.FLAT, DistanceMethod.COSINE, dims: 128))
    {
        for (ulong i = 1; i <= 50; i++)
        {
            float[] vector = Enumerable.Repeat((float)i / 100, dims).ToArray();
            flat.Insert(i, vector, dims);
        }

        // Automatic persistence to JSON file (in ./.victor/)
        string path = VictorPersistence.DumpToAutoPath(flat, dims, IndexType.FLAT, DistanceMethod.COSINE);
    }

    // Step 2: Load into hierarchical index (HNSW) for fast searches
    using (var hnsw = VictorPersistence.LoadFromFile(path))
    {
        float[] query = Enumerable.Repeat(0.3f, dims).ToArray();
        var result = hnsw.Search(query, dims);

        Assert.IsTrue(result.Label > 0);
        Console.WriteLine($"Match ID: {result.Label}, Distance: {result.Distance}");
    }

    File.Delete(path); // Optional cleanup
}
```

## üìÇ File Handling and Automatic Persistence

# When you use DumpToAutoPath, the system:

- Creates a `.victor/` folder at the project root if it doesn't exist.
- Saves the file with a unique name: `victor_index_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_GUID.json`
- Automatically creates a `.gitignore` inside `.victor/` that ignores everything except the `.gitignore` itself.

## üß† When should you use this pattern?

- When you want to preprocess data quickly with FLAT, but need optimal search performance with HNSW.
- When you're testing and want to save JSON snapshots for comparison.
- When developing an app where you need to save and restore persistent indices between runs.

# This ensures:

- You won't accidentally commit dumps to your repo.
- You can keep a local collection of snapshots for testing, debugging, etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Manual Persistence (if you want more control)

- If you want to fully control where the file is saved:

```csharp
string customPath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop), "my_index.json");
VictorPersistence.DumpToFile(flat, customPath, dims, IndexType.FLAT, DistanceMethod.COSINE, flat.GetInsertedVectors());
```

- Or set a base path (Recomended):

```csharp
var CustomPath = VictorPersistence.SetBasePath("C:\\MyProject\\VectorDumps");
```

- After that, you can keep using DumpToAutoPath(CustomPath ...) and files will be saved there.

## Want to see all saved vectors?

- Just open the `.json` file, you'll see a structure like this:

```json
{
  "Dimensions": 128,
  "IndexType": "FLAT",
  "Method": "COSINE",
  "Vectors": [
    {
      "Id": 1,
      "Vector": [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, ...]
    },
    {
      "Id": 2,
      "Vector": [0.02, 0.02, 0.02, ...]
    }
  ]
}
```
